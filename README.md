### Activating in-game

1. Launch the game and use `/xlsettings` in chat or `xlsettings` in the Dalamud Console to open up the Dalamud settings.
    * In here, go to `Experimental`, and add the full path to the `SamplePlugin.dll` to the list of Dev Plugin Locations.
2. Next, use `/xlplugins` (chat) or `xlplugins` (console) to open up the Plugin Installer.
    * In here, go to `Dev Tools > Installed Dev Plugins`, and the `SamplePlugin` should be visible. Enable it.
3. You should now be able to use `/pmycommand` (chat) or `pmycommand` (console)!

Note that you only need to add it to the Dev Plugin Locations once (Step 1); it is preserved afterwards. You can disable, enable, or load your plugin on startup through the Plugin Installer.
